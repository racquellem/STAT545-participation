<!---The following chunk allows errors when knitting--->

```{r allow errors, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(error = TRUE, warning = FALSE)
```

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(gapminder))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tsibble))
```


This worksheet contains exercises aimed for practice with `dplyr`. 


1. (a) What's the minimum life expectancy for each continent and each year? (b) Add the corresponding country to the tibble, too. (c) Arrange by min life expectancy.

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(continent,year) %>% 
    summarise(min_life = min(lifeExp),
              country = country[lifeExp == min_life]) %>% 
  arrange(min_life)
```
#summarise= compressing to a single number
#don't want min life expectancy for each country

2. Calculate the growth in population since the first year on record _for each country_ by rearranging the following lines, and filling in the `FILL_THIS_IN`. Here's another convenience function for you: `dplyr::first()`. 

```
mutate(rel_growth = FILL_THIS_IN) %>% 
arrange(FILL_THIS_IN) %>% 
gapminder %>% 
DT::datatable()
group_by(country) %>% 
```

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  arrange(year) %>% 
  mutate(rel_growth = pop-first(pop)) %>% 
  DT::datatable()
```

#group by or arrange, doesn't matter order
# by default arrange is in descending order

3. Determine the country that experienced the sharpest 5-year drop in life expectancy, in each continent, sorted by the drop, by rearranging the following lines of code. Ensure there are no `NA`'s. Instead of using `lag()`, use the convenience function provided by the `tsibble` package, `tsibble::difference()`:

```
drop_na() %>% 
ungroup() %>% 
arrange(year) %>% 
filter(inc_life_exp == min(inc_life_exp)) %>% 
gapminder %>% 
mutate(inc_life_exp = FILL_THIS_IN) %>% 
arrange(inc_life_exp) %>% 
group_by(country) %>% 
group_by(continent) %>% 
knitr::kable()
```

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  arrange(year) %>% 
  mutate(inc_life_exp = difference(lifeExp)) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  group_by(continent) %>% 
  filter(inc_life_exp == min(inc_life_exp)) %>% 
  arrange(inc_life_exp) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

#ungroup not by country anymore but rather by continent
#filtering happening independently for each group
