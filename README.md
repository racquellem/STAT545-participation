### STAT545 101 Participation Repository (2019)

> Hi! Welcome to my participation repo for STAT 545. Here you can find all the files I've completed for each class meeting,  
> where I learned about various subjects such as data wrangling, ggplots (my favourite) and all about tibbles. 
> Below are the links to the folder and corresponding html files that have been produced throughout some class meetings (:
