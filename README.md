# STAT545 101 Participation Repository (2019)

Hi! Welcome to my participation repo for STAT 545. Here you can find all the files I've completed for each class meeting, where I learned about various subjects such as data wrangling, ggplots (my favourite) and all about tibbles. 

Below are the links to html files that have been produced throughout some class meetings:
