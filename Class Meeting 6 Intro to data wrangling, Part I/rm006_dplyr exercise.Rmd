<!---The following chunk allows errors when knitting--->

```{r allow errors, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(error = TRUE)
```

**Optional, but recommended startup**:

1. Change the file output to both html and md _documents_ (not notebook).

2. `knit` the document. 

3. Stage and commit the rmd, and knitted documents.

# Intro to `dplyr` syntax

Load the `gapminder` and `tidyverse` packages. Hint: `suppressPackageStartupMessages()`!
    - This loads `dplyr`, too.
    
```{r load packages, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# load your packages here:
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
```
    

## `select()` (8 min)

1. Make a data frame containing the columns `year`, `lifeExp`, `country` from the gapminder data, in that order.

```{r}
select(gapminder, year, lifeExp, country)
```
# (dataframe, columns you want to select)


2. Select all variables, from `country` to `lifeExp`.

```{r}
# This will work:
select(gapminder, country, continent, year, lifeExp)

# Better way:
select(gapminder, country:lifeExp)
```
# selects all columns in between


3. Select all variables, except `lifeExp`.

```{r}
select(gapminder, -lifeExp)
```

# want to include all columns EXCEPT that one 

4. Put `continent` first. Hint: use the `everything()` function.

```{r}
select(gapminder, continent, everything())
```

# fix order of columns such that continent is first 

5. Rename `continent` to `cont`.

```{r}
# compare
select(gapminder, cont = continent, everything())

rename(gapminder, cont = continent)
```

#rename, and also change column order

## `arrange()` (8 min)

1. Order by year.

```{r}
arrange(gapminder, year)
```

# arrange years together, numerically 

2. Order by year, in descending order.

```{r}
arrange(gapminder, desc(year), desc(lifeExp))
```

# desc=descending order that is
3. Order by year, then by life expectancy.

```{r}
arrange(gapminder, year, lifeExp)
```

#within each year, ordered by life expectancy

## Piping, `%>%` (8 min)
# allows you to think of functions sequentially and also write it sequentially in the order you are writing

Note: think of `%>%` as the word "then"!

Demonstration:

Here I want to combine `select()` Task 1 with `arrange()` Task 3.

This is how I could do it by *nesting* the two function calls:

```{r nesting functions example, eval = F}
# Nesting function calls can be hard to read
arrange(select(gapminder, year, lifeExp, country), year, lifeExp)
```

Now using with pipes:

```{r}
# alter the below to include 2 "pipes"
gapminder %>%
    select(year, lifeExp, country) %>% #this line selects columns year... 
    arrange (year, lifeExp)
```


# select= dataframe, then the other arguments- columns you want to select, first argument of the second function and that is to arrange (doesn't arrange the columns but the dataset)

# Resume lecture 

Return to guide at section 6.7.

## `filter()` (10 min)

1. Only take data with population greater than 100 million.

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  filter(pop > 100000000)
```

2. Your turn: of those rows filtered from step 1., only take data from Asia.

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  filter(pop > 100000000) %>% 
  filter (continent=='Asia')
```

```{r}
gapminder %>%
   filter(pop > 100000000 & continent=='Asia')
```

```{r}
gapminder %>%
   filter(pop > 100000000, 
          continent=='Asia')
```

# 3 different ways to write this out 

3. Take data from countries Brazil, and China. 

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  filter (country=='Brazil' | country== 'China')
```

## `mutate()` (10 min)

Let's get: 

- GDP by multiplying GPD per capita with population, and
- GDP in billions, named (`gdpBill`), rounded to two decimals.

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  mutate(gdpBill= gdpPercap*pop/1000000000)
```

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  mutate(gdpBill= round(gdpPercap*pop/1000000000, digits=2))
```
# multiplying columns together (gdpPercap*pop) to create a new one (gdpBill), and dividing them by a billion, and also rounding to 2 significant digits (if you dont want the round then just delete round()

Notice the backwards compatibility! No need for loops!

Try the same thing, but with `transmute` (drops all other variables). 

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  transmute(gdpBill= gdpPercap*pop/1000000000)
```

# it mutates and also deletes (or mute in other words) all other columns 

The `if_else` function is useful for changing certain elements in a data frame.

Example: Suppose Canada's 1952 life expectancy was mistakenly entered as 68.8 in the data frame, but is actually 70. Fix it using `if_else` and `mutate`. 

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  mutate(lifeExp=if_else(country=='Canada' & year==1952, 70, lifeExp))
```

# first argument is a particular condition, second is what we put in when that condition is met, third is the output 

Your turn: Make a new column called `cc` that pastes the country name followed by the continent, separated by a comma. (Hint: use the `paste` function with the `sep=", "` argument).

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  mutate(cc=paste(country,sep="country,continent"))
```

These functions we've seen are called __vectorized functions__.

## git stuff (Optional)

Knit, commit, push!

# Bonus Exercises

If there's time remaining, we'll practice with these three exercises. I'll give you 1 minute for each, then we'll go over the answer.

1. Take all countries in Europe that have a GDP per capita greater than 10000, and select all variables except `gdpPercap`. (Hint: use `-`).

2. Take the first three columns, and extract the names.

3. Of the `iris` data frame, take all columns that start with the word "Petal". 
    - Hint: take a look at the "Select helpers" documentation by running the following code: `?tidyselect::select_helpers`.
    
4. Convert the population to a number in billions.

5. Filter the rows of the iris dataset for Sepal.Length >= 4.6 and Petal.Width >= 0.5.
